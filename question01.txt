Hi,

I'm trying to get familiar with STONITH Block Devices (SBD) on a 3-node CentOS7 built in VirtualBox.
The setup is available at https://github.com/marcindulak/vagrant-sbd-tutorial-centos7.git
so hopefully with some help I'll be able to make it work.

Question 1:
The shared device /dev/sbd1 is the VirtualBox's "shareable hard disk" https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html#hdimagewrites
will SBD fencing work with that type of storage?

I start the cluster using vagrant_1.8.1 and virtualbox-4.3 with:
$ vagrant up  # takes ~15 minutes

The setup brings up the nodes, installs the necessary packages, and prepares for the configuration of the pcs cluster.
You can see which scripts the nodes execute at the bottom of the Vagrantfile.
While there is 'yum -y install sbd' on CentOS7 the fence_sbd agent has not been packaged yet.
Therefore I rebuild Fedora 24 package using the latest https://github.com/ClusterLabs/fence-agents/archive/v4.0.22.tar.gz
plus the update to the fence_sbd from https://github.com/ClusterLabs/fence-agents/pull/73

After reading http://blog.clusterlabs.org/blog/2015/sbd-fun-and-profit I expect with just one sotnith resource configured
a node will be fenced when I stop pacemaker and corosync `pcs cluster stop node` or just `stonith_admin -F node`, but this is not the case.

The configuration is inspired by https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7009485 and
https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/book_sleha/data/sec_ha_storage_protect_fencing.html

In order to configure stonith on the cluster and test it I run the following commands:

$ sh -x run01.sh 2>&1 | tee run01.txt

with the following result:

$ cat run01.txt
